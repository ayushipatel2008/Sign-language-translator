# Sign-language-translator
The goal of this project is to design and implement a real-time sign language  translator that can recognize and translate sign language gestures into spoken language or  text. The system will use Raspberry Pi 4B, sensors, and machine learning  algorithms for gesture recognition. 

Run the source code for model file on Jupyter Notebook. Make sure to choose the correct version of python - 2.4 as my Raspberry Pi 4B had python 2.4 as it's latest version. You can update your CPU or code accordingly. 

Once the gesture_model.h5 or gesture_model.keras file is generated, run the real_time_detection file and your video streaming will begin.
